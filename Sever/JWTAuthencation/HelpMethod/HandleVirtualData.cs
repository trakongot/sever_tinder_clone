				"Getting lost is not scary; the scariest thing is not knowing where you are going. When you are determined to step forward, you will reach your final destination.",
				"A scar on your body is also a lesson, an experience not to repeat mistakes.",
				"Living in this world, you should know where you stand. If you are not older than anyone, don't demand to be someone else's father.",
				"Words spoken can kill someone in pain, while a comforting word can make someone feel like they're on cloud nine. Think carefully before speaking, don't make unnecessary remarks.",
				"You don't need others to say anything; I only trust myself.",
				"A good meal can save a person's life, a kind word can change an entire future, and the right action leads to the two words 'success'.",
				"The most common form of despair is not being able to be oneself.",
				"Take it slow to know whether you are heading in the right direction or not. What's the rush when you only realize you are lost after you've run fast?",
				"If you expect an angel to come to you, then get up and build your own paradise. Angels don't live in hell; if your life doesn't amount to anything, don't dream.",
				"Usually, we think about our New Year's resolutions. However, it's a fact that if you spend too much time and energy on things you shouldn't do, you won't have time and strength for what you want to do.",
				"Always dream and aim higher than your abilities. Don't worry about doing better than contemporaries or those who came before you. Strive to be better than yourself.",
				"When you have an exceptionally great talent, don't do it for free.",
				"Today, people misunderstand you, tomorrow is the same, who knows if they will understand the day after, but you will still be you, the beloved child of your family.",
				"Don't try to please others if you are not sure that they love you. Go home and please your parents instead.",
				"Live for yourself because no one cries for you.",
				"Don't try to wake up someone who is deeply asleep, just as you shouldn't force others to listen to you.",
				"Walking on your own feet is pride, what's the point of walking on your knees?",
				"Your appearance is given to you by your parents, so why harm it for someone else? Is it fair?",
				"Don't compare yourself to others, and you won't know who is sweeter without tasting tears.",
				"Being too honest is a crime, being too loyal is stupidity."
